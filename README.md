# Python Projects Command Sheet.

A simple repository - mainly containing a sheet with commands, to streamline the workflow process when working on 
Python projects.

> It's a frustrating thing when you have to keep struggling to find or recall basic project commands when working with Python. I created this simple but powerful cheat-sheet, to help streamline the workflow process when I'm working on Python projects.

> Me: ðŸ˜’ - it' simply silly to keep running your head around, asking an AI helper for the same commands when working on every new project. It makes more sense to have them in one place - once for all, where you can return to access them. That provides a lot more order.
