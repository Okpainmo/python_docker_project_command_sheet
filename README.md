# Python Docker Project Command Sheet

A simple repository - mainly containing a sheet with commands, to streamline the workflow process when working on Python projects with Docker.

> It's a frustrating thing when you have to keep struggling to find or recall basic project commands when working with Python. So I created this simple but powerful cheat-sheet, to help streamline the workflow process when I'm working on Python projects - with Docker. 
>
> How about asking AI helper?
>
> Me: ðŸ˜’ - it' simply silly to keep running your head around, asking an AI helper for the same commands when working on every new project.
