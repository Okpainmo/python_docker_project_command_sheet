## Python Docker Project Command Sheet

A simple repository(mainly) containing a simple sheet with commands to streamline the workflow process when working on Python projects with Docker.

> It's a frustrating thing when you have to keep struggling to find or recall basic project commands when working with Python. So I created this simple but powerful cheat-sheet, to help streamline the workflow process when I'm working on Python projects - with Docker.

> How about getting help from AI?

> Me: 😒 - it' simply silly to keep running your head around, asking an AI helper for the same commands when working every new project.
